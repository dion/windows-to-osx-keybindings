# Change Windows shortcut keys to OSX keys

# Requirements
* [Download sharpkeys](https://www.randyrants.com/category/sharpkeys/)

# [Create these keybindings from this screenshot](https://github.com/dion/windows-to-osx-keybindings/blob/master/sharpkeys-screenshot.png)

* [Download autohotkey](https://www.autohotkey.com/)

# [Use my autohotkey script] (https://github.com/dion/windows-to-osx-keybindings/blob/master/alt-tab.ahk)
this script fixes the alt-tab to behave more like osx

# TODO
I still need to figure out how to write the autohotkey script to bind `ctrl + ~` keys to switch between tabs within an application context
